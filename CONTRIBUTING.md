# Goals
The _Superstar Game Suite_ ultimately aims to be an intuitive, data-driven, and scalable, tool that can be integrated into another Game Maker Studio 2 project with reasonable convenience. Ideal contributions reflect this goal.

# Issue Tracking
Issue tracking is a high priority task. This project has, thus far, been developed almost entirely by a single programmer. As it is rather ambitious in scope, sufficient time to polish and fix bugs has not yet been alloted. There are undoubtedly many bugs yet undiscovered.

# Feature Requests
Feature requests, particularly with regards to the user interface and user experience, are also greatly appreciated. They are currently a secondary priority to bug fixes, but it is intended for the interface to eventually improve significantly in some (yet undetermined) ways.

# Code Quality
Almost all content, excepting that otherwise labeled, has so far been created by a single developer. Sufficient time has not yet been alloted to bring the codebase to a high standard of quality, and much improvement is possible for optimization, intuitiveness, and comment clarity.
